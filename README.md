# schedule

Send scheduled  messages in Slack

## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with Administrator permission
* [NodeJS 10.10+ installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/)

* [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)

## Setup process

### Local development

**Invoking function locally using a local sample payload**

```bash
sam local invoke ScheduleFunction --event event.json
```
 
**Invoking function locally through local API Gateway**

```bash
sam local start-api
```

If the previous command ran successfully you should now be able to hit the following local endpoint to invoke your function `http://localhost:3000/hello`

## Packaging and deployment

AWS Lambda NodeJS runtime requires a flat folder with all dependencies including the application. SAM will use `CodeUri` property to know where to look up for both application and dependencies:

```yaml
...
    ScheduleFunction:
        Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
        Properties:
            CodeUri: hello-world/
            ...
```

Firstly, we need a `S3 bucket` where we can upload our Lambda functions packaged as ZIP before we deploy anything - If you don't have a S3 bucket to store code artifacts then this is a good time to create one:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://BUCKET_NAME
```

Next, run the following command to package our Lambda function to S3:

```bash
sam package \
    --template-file template.yaml \
    --output-template-file output-template.yaml \
    --s3-bucket REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME
```

Next, the following command will create a Cloudformation Stack and deploy your SAM resources.

```bash
sam deploy \
    --template-file output-template.yaml \
    --stack-name schedule \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

> **See [Serverless Application Model (SAM) HOWTO Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-quick-start.html) for more details in how to get started.**

After deployment is complete you can run the following command to retrieve the API Gateway Endpoint URL:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name schedule \
    --query 'Stacks[].Outputs[?OutputKey==`ScheduleApi`]' \
    --output table
``` 

## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called sam logs. sam logs lets you fetch logs generated by your Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

`NOTE`: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not just the ones you deploy using SAM.

```bash
sam logs -n ScheduleFunction --stack-name schedule --tail
```

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [SAM CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

## Testing

We use `mocha` for testing our code and it is already added in `package.json` under `scripts`, so that we can simply run the following command to run our tests:

```bash
cd hello-world
yarn
yarn test
```

## Cleanup

In order to delete our Serverless Application recently deployed you can use the following AWS CLI Command:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name schedule

# instead
make clean
```

## SAM and AWS CLI commands

All commands used throughout this document

```bash
# Invoke function locally with event.json as an input
sam local invoke ScheduleFunction --event event.json

# Run API Gateway locally
sam local start-api

# Package Lambda function defined locally and upload to S3 as an artifact
sam package \
    --template-file template.yaml \
    --output-template-file output-template.yaml \
    --s3-bucket REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME

# instead
make package

# Deploy SAM template as a CloudFormation stack
sam deploy \
